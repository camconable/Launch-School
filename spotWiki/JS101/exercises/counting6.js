// Create a function that takes a string as an argument and returns a number representing number of words that occurred more than once in that string, for example:
    
countDuplic('one two one three two'); //=> 2
countDuplic('flower cat cat dog flower dog'); //=> 3

// input: string
// output: number (of words appearing more than once)

// if duplicate then 

// Create a function that takes a string as an argument and returns a number representing occurrences of all letters that appears exactly twice, for example:
    
countDuplic('123123'); //=> 3
countDuplic('abcdea ab'); //=> 1
