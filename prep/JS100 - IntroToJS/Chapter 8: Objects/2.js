// 2) Which of the following values are valid keys for an object?

// 1
// '1'
// undefined
// 'hello world'
// true
// 'true'

// they're all valid. object keys are coerced into strings if they are not already strings. in the above example there will be keys with duplicate names, since non-string keys are coerced into strings; this would likely be a problem.
