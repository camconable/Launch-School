// 12) What value does the following expression evaluate to?

// '12' < '9'

// it evaluates to true because when comparing strings it compares character by character, left to right. It compares '1' < '9' which evaluates to true. This is the only comparison evaluated since there is no character to the right of '9' (to compare '2' to, in the next iteration, for example; if there were, it would compare the them then return the boolean result of that comparison).
