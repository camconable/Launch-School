// 7) Will an error occur if you try to access an array element with an index that is greater than or equal to the length of the array? For example:

// let foo = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
// console.log(foo.length);  // => 3
// console.log(foo[3]);      // will this result in an error?

// The last line will not result in an error, but instead return undefined. It's accessing a location in memory that hasn't been defined. JavaScript has no reason to throw an error or halt the program.
