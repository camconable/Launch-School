// 7) What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

// Cam's answer: Exception handling assists with handling non-serious
// errors gracefully. When these errors are handled it allows the program
// to continue to run, because some exceptions can halt the program. Exception
// handling can help the programmer troubleshoot errors, log errors,
// and handle a variety of outcomes

// LS answer: Exception handling is a process that deals with errors in a 
// manageable and predictable manner. It uses the try/catch statement to catch
//  exceptions that the code in the try block raises, and lets the programmer 
//  deal with the problem in a way that makes sense and perhaps prevents a 
//  catastrophic failure or nasty bug.
