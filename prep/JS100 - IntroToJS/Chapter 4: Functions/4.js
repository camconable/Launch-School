// 4) What does the following code log to the console?

// function scream(words) {
//   words = words + '!!!!';
//   return;
//   console.log(words);
// }

// scream('Yipeee');

// it logs nothing to the console and returns undefined. console.log was not able to run because the return statement terminated the function before line 4 was able to run.
