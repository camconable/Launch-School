// 11) Using the code from Exercise 9, are the left and right variables on lines 1 and 2 the same as the left and right variables on lines 10-12? Explain your reasoning.

// they are not the same. lines 1 and 2 are local variables that shadow the global variables when they're declared in the function. they cease to exist after the function terminates. lines 10-12 left/right are global variables
