// 1) Write a dynamic greeter program named greeter.js. The program should ask for your name, then output Hello, {name}! where {name} is the name you entered:

// let rlSync = require('readline-sync');

// let input = rlSync.question('What is your name? ');
// console.log(`Hello, ${input}!`);


// 2) Modify the greeter.js program to ask for the user's first and last names separately, then greet the user with their full name.

// let rlSync = require('readline-sync');

// let fName = rlSync.question('What is your first name? ');
// let lName = rlSync.question('What is your last name? ');
// console.log(`Hello, ${fName} ${lName}!`);

// 3) Modify the age.js program you wrote in the exercises for the Variables chapter. The updated code should ask the user to enter their age instead of hard-coding the age in the program. 

// let rlSync = require('readline-sync');

// let age = Number(rlSync.question('How old are you? '));

// console.log(`In 10 years you will be ${age + 10} years old.`);
// console.log(`In 20 years you will be ${age + 20} years old.`);
// console.log(`In 30 years you will be ${age + 30} years old.`);
// console.log(`In 40 years you will be ${age + 40} years old.`);
